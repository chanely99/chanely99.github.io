            An Objective Ranking on How to Best Cook an Egg
          </div>
          <div class="row blogpost">
              <ol reversed>
                <li>
                Omelet
                </li>
                  <p>
                    This is an easy bottom of the list for one simple fact: you don't eat an omelet for the eggy-ness of the omelet. In fact, the texture of the egg is often ruined in most typical omelets due to the cook time needed to melt the inside cheese or cook the mushrooms(best omelet addition fight me). This isn't to say omelets are bad, they're fantastic and I've eaten one every week since Quarantine started. But as far as the best form an egg can take, it's definitively stuck at the bottom.  
                  </p>
                <li>
                Over Hard
                </li>
                  <p>
                    Over Hard is the egg you get when you're trying to cook an over easy but accidentally check your phone for messages for a bit too long. Then, you're stuck with an egg with a hard yolk, which is just... so sad. People who deliberately eat eggs over hard are probably the same people who throw away the cone after eating an ice cream. 
                  </p>
                <li>
                Hard Boiled
                </li>
                  <p>
                    Hard Boiled is also stuck at the bottom of the list because of its characteristic hard yolk, but gets points for portability and storability. Yes, the texture of the white becomes plastic-y rubbery, and the yolk turns nasty grey, but when you're at a gas station in the middle of nowhere and you grab one of these and sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper on it it'll be one of the best things you've ever eaten. But I wouldn't eat it at home where I have other options like: 
                  </p>
                <li>
                Poached
                </li>
                  <p>
                    My opinion on poached eggs have fluctuated over the years, mainly depending on my ability to produce them consistently. Until college, poached eggs had always seemed so difficult to make - how do you cook an egg in open boiling water without turning it into water-with-floating-egg-parts soup? Then I actually tried making it and wow it was super easy. Unlike the previous entries on this list, poached eggs have the potential to have a runny yolk, which is a distinguishing feature. But the main downside is in how it's made. By being boiled, the egg whites have a slick, slippery texture, and as a result poached eggs aren't that good on their own. But paired with some toast or on some rice and you're golden. 
                  </p>
                <li>
                Scrambled
                </li>
                  <p>
                    A classic for a reason. Scrambled eggs are usually the product of messing up an over easy or sunny side up, but much like a phoenix rising from the ashes, it still  becomes something great. Scrambled eggs just can't be beat for their simplicity and variety, and if I was making a more detailed list about the different ways to cook eggs "soft-scrambled" eggs with cheese and a bit of milk will take the top spot. But even standard scrambled eggs earn themselves a high spot. 
                  </p>
                <li>
                Over Easy
                </li>
                  <p>
                    This is probably the kind of egg you were trying to make when you messed up and broke the yolk or accidentally cooked it for too long. Over Easy is a classic -> being fried in oil it has a wonderful brown outside while maintaining a runny yolk that will add a creamy texture to whatever carb you're eating it with. Easiest breakfast ever: over easy egg + soy sauce + rice. 
                  </p>
                <li>
                Sunny Side Up
                </li>
                  <p>
                    This is the best form an egg can ever possibly hope to achieve. The bright yellow yolk on top of a disk of shiny white, with a bottom crispened by the oil it was fried in. When you think "cooked egg" of course you think of this yellow-white thingies.
