            Staying Sane During a Pandemic

                Yup, like everyone and their mother, I too am about to drop some unsolicited advice on how I've been keeping sane during quarantine. Hopefully this'll be helpful, and if not - well, use the googles to find other articles about this exact same topic. 
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                Schedule and commit to your social activities
                </li>
                  <p>
                    Being a college student, socializing isn't really too difficult. Okay, making friends is hard at any stage of life, but at school most of them are always within a 10 minute walk from your dorm or apartment. 
                  </p>
                <li>
                Use a buddy for accountability
                </li>
                <p>
                  
                </p>
                <li>
                Pick up a "creative" hobby
                </li>
                <p>
                  Yeah so everyone says to pick up a hobby, but in the first few months of quarantine I was still not getting the seratonin I expected from them. I tried listening to podcasts, watching a ton more of Netflix, grinding out leetcode, and reading books from high school, but all of them ended up feeling like chores rather than hobbies.  
                </p>
                <li>
                Get out of the house
                </li>
                  <p>
                    Of everything on this list I think this is both the easiest and the most rewarding. Just go outside, walk around the neighborhood and plug in your earbuds. Obviously wear a mask and don't invade the personal space of others. I've walked the same route around my neighborhood at the same time for a consistent 45 minutes every day, and it's done wonders for my mental health. Besides getting Vitamin D and breathing air that didn't come out of my family's mouths,
